### Hello World! 👋  
My name is Danijela Vrzan, I'm an iOS Developer, conference speaker, and content creator from Croatia, currently living in Toronto, Canada.

I switched my civil engineering career and never looked back. Today, I write and speak about all things Swift, app development, career growth, and the human side of software.

I'm working on my macro & calorie tracking app - Nunch.
